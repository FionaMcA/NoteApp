# NoteApp
This application is designed for students to help them organise their day to day tasks within a study environment. In an ideal world,
the student will log into their educational insitutation. Once logged in, they are then able to make notes whether it's on their studies or
personal which saves automatically in one place. They are able to add, delete or edit each note. The purpose of this, is that students can
access all their notes in one place and it is easy to manage.
